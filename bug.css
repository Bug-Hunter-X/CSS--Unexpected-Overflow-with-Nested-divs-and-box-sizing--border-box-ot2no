The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This seems simple, but the issue arises when the `div` is nested within other elements that also use `box-sizing: border-box`.  The `100%` width calculation becomes unpredictable, leading to unexpected layout quirks, often causing the inner `div` to overflow its parent.
